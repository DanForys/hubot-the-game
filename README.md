# You just lost the game

A Hubot script to hilariously and randomly prevent you from winning The Game.
Which you just lost incidentally.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)

## Installation

Navigate to your Hubot instance's directory and run `npm i hubot-the-game --save`, and add `"hubot-the-game"` to the array in the `external-scripts.json` file. Then simply redeploy your bot.

## Odds

Every message has a 1:1000 chance of losing the game. You can change this default
by setting the `HUBOT_GAME_ODDS` environment variable.

## Usage

You do not use The Game. The Game uses you.
